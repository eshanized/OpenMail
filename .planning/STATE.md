### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Laravel 12 + Livewire 3 + Tailwind 4 stack confirmed via research
- Phase 1: webklex/php-imap for IMAP, Symfony Mailer for SMTP, php-mime-mail-parser for MIME
- Phase 1: HTMLPurifier (server) + DOMPurify (client) dual sanitization strategy

- Phase 2 Plan 1: IMAP SPECIAL-USE folder mapping with name-based heuristic fallback
- Phase 2 Plan 1: Database caching of folder counts with UIDVALIDITY-based invalidation
- Phase 2 Plan 1: Alpine.js bulk selection with shift-click range selection
- Phase 2 Plan 2: Extracted message data as simple types to avoid Livewire serialization issues with webklex Message objects
- Phase 2 Plan 2: Dual sanitization pipeline: HTMLPurifier (server) → DOMPurify (client) → sandboxed iframe
- Phase 2 Plan 2: Remote images blocked by default via data-src rewrite with user opt-in
- Phase 2 Plan 2: Attachment downloads use UUID-prefixed filenames and MIME type validation
